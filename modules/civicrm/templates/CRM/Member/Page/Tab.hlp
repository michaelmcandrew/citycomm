  <p>{ts}Membership status is normally assigned and updated automatically based on your configured membership status rules. However, if you want to assign a status manually and bypass automated status setting, check this box. Then you can select from the available status options.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}The status you assign will remain in force, unless it is again modified on this screen. As long as the Status Override flag is checked, the automated membership status update script will NOT update this membership record.{/ts}</p>
